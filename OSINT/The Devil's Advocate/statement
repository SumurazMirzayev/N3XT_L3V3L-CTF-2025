An old intelligence dossier, declassified after decades, contains a single cryptic reference. It speaks of a critical Cold War outpost located on a man-made hill in West Germany, built entirely from the rubble of a city destroyed in the previous war.
The key feature of this location was its strange, domed structures, which housed advanced antennas to eavesdrop on Soviet, East German, and other Warsaw Pact military communications. Our sources indicate this "listening post" was a joint operation, but it was primarily run by the US Army Security Agency (ASA) and its successor, the US Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to first identify this station. Once you have identified the location, find the three-digit numeric designation of the primary US Army Military Intelligence Battalion that operated from it during the height of its activity in the 1980s.

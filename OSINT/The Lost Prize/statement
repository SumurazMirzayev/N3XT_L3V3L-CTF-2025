"The aviator's deep-sea gambit was underway. To the world, we were prospectors, chasing mineral fortunes on the abyssal plains. Our orbital sentry, the one they call 'Big Bird', had already pinpointed the carcass's location after its silent, catastrophic descent. The lift was... compromised. The mechanical claw, our great steel leviathan, couldn't maintain its grip.

We recovered the serpent's fangs and its cryptic songbook, but the leviathan's spine shattered during the ascent. The most valuable sections—the heart of its propulsion and its primary arsenal—were lost, returning to the crushing dark. Pinpoint the final resting place of that wreckage."
